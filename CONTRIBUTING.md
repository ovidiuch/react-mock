## How to contribute

### Intention

Please take a minute to understand this project's purpose and ensure your contribution is thoughtful and relevant. Preserving the integrity of an open source project is hard. Thanks!

### Check your code

You have the following weapons at your disposal: `yarn lint`, `yarn flow` and `yarn test`. Use them.

### New package

Run `yarn new-package` and you'll follow this friendly flow that will generate initial boilerplate.

### Docs

Each package has its own README. This is useful for keeping docs close to code, as well as for showing docs on each package's npm page.

**The root README is generated using a script. Do not edit it by hand.** It's assembled from a [template](scripts/templates/README.md), individual package docs and the CONTRIBUTING.md.

Run `npm generate-readme` when you want to update the root README.
